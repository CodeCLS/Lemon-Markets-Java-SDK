Hey there,
I am Caleb and I have been working on this sdk since a day now. 
This SDK is not developed by lemon.markets and the company is not afiliated with me.
However, I enjoyed the API so much, that I decided to create a simple SDK for Java. 
I hope you enjoy it.

PS: 
Soon to be uploaded to gradle and hopefully more features included soon


build.gradle implementation(Jitpack): 
```groovy
allprojects {
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

```groovy
	dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.CodeCLS:Lemon-Markets-Java-SDK:1.0.0.0'
	}
```

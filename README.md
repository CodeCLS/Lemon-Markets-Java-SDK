Hey there,
this SDK is not developed by lemon.markets and the company is not afiliated with me.
However, I enjoyed the API so much, that I decided to create a simple SDK for Java. 
I hope you enjoy it.


build.gradle implementation(Jitpack): 
```groovy
allprojects {
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.CodeCLS:Lemon-Markets-Java-SDK:1.0.0.0'
}
```
